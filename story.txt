Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Siddharth,

I am writing to you from a Ephemeral spaceship in a Ethereal galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a Blue rocket in August. There are 9 Birds and Animals of Pond here! In the
Reveille there is a pool full of Cola. I fall asleep each night on a Flibbertigibbetty bed of
Marshmallowcrete and dream of Sleeping Overdramatically. It feels as though I have lived here for
9 minutes . I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
bungee jumping  on a gigantic Ferrari!!

Best wishes,
Akankshai
